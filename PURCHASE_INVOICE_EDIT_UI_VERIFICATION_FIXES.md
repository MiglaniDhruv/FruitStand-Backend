# Purchase Invoice Edit - Verification Fixes

## Overview
This document details the verification fixes applied to the purchase invoice edit UI implementation after thorough code review to address state management, data consistency, and user experience issues.

---

## Comment 1: Fixed stale state when switching from Edit to Create mode

**Issue:** When editing an invoice and then clicking "Create Invoice," the modal could show stock entries from the previously selected vendor due to stale `selectedVendorId` state.

**Location:** `client/src/pages/purchase-invoices.tsx`

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Added unique `key` prop to `PurchaseInvoiceModal` component
- ✅ Key changes between modes: `key={editingInvoice ? editingInvoice.id : 'create'}`
- ✅ Causes complete remounting when switching between create and edit
- ✅ Ensures all internal state is reset when mode changes

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
<PurchaseInvoiceModal 
  open={showCreateModal} 
  onOpenChange={setShowCreateModal}
  invoice={editingInvoice}
/>

// AFTER
<PurchaseInvoiceModal 
  key={editingInvoice ? editingInvoice.id : 'create'}
  open={showCreateModal} 
  onOpenChange={setShowCreateModal}
  invoice={editingInvoice}
/>
```

**Impact:** Prevents stale vendor selection and stock entries from appearing when switching between edit and create modes.

---

## Comment 2: Disabled vendor selection in Edit mode

**Issue:** Vendor select remained editable in Edit mode, allowing users to change the vendor which could cause inconsistencies with linked stock entries, crate transactions, and invoice relationships.

**Location:** `client/src/components/forms/purchase-invoice-modal.tsx` - Vendor Select component

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Added `disabled={!!invoice}` prop to vendor `Select` component
- ✅ Vendor field becomes read-only when editing an existing invoice
- ✅ Prevents vendor changes that could break data integrity

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
<Select onValueChange={handleVendorChange} value={field.value}>

// AFTER
<Select onValueChange={handleVendorChange} value={field.value} disabled={!!invoice}>
```

**Impact:** 
- Prevents vendor–stock/invoice inconsistency
- Maintains data integrity between invoice and related entities
- Aligns with backend validation (vendor changes would require complex cascade updates)

**Rationale:** Changing vendor in edit mode would require:
- Re-validating all linked stock movements belong to new vendor
- Updating crate transaction party reference
- Potentially orphaning payments or other linked records
- Backend does not support vendor changes (no cascade logic)

---

## Comment 3: Gated stock-out entries query behind create mode

**Issue:** Edit mode was still fetching available stock-out entries for the vendor even though they cannot be selected/changed during edit.

**Location:** `client/src/components/forms/purchase-invoice-modal.tsx` - Stock movements query

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Updated query `enabled` condition from `!!selectedVendorId` to `!!selectedVendorId && !invoice`
- ✅ Query only runs in create mode when vendor is selected
- ✅ Prevents unnecessary API calls in edit mode

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
const { data: availableStockOutEntries, ... } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["/api/stock-movements/vendor", selectedVendorId, "available"],
  queryFn: async () => { ... },
  enabled: !!selectedVendorId,
});

// AFTER
const { data: availableStockOutEntries, ... } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["/api/stock-movements/vendor", selectedVendorId, "available"],
  queryFn: async () => { ... },
  enabled: !!selectedVendorId && !invoice,
});
```

**Impact:** 
- Reduces unnecessary API calls
- Improves performance in edit mode
- Clarifies intent (stock entries only relevant for creation)

---

## Comment 4: Crate transaction removal semantics confirmed

**Issue:** Concern that turning off crate transaction in Edit mode might not remove the existing record server-side.

**Backend Investigation:**
Examined `server/src/modules/purchase-invoices/model.ts` `updatePurchaseInvoice()` method:

**Phase 3: Delete old crate transactions**
```typescript
// Backend always deletes ALL old crate transactions
const crateTransactionsList = await tx.select().from(crateTransactions)
  .where(and(
    withTenant(crateTransactions, tenantId),
    eq(crateTransactions.purchaseInvoiceId, invoiceId)
  ));

// ... calculates reverse balance change ...

// Delete all crate transactions
await tx.delete(crateTransactions)
  .where(and(
    withTenant(crateTransactions, tenantId),
    eq(crateTransactions.purchaseInvoiceId, invoiceId)
  ));
```

**Phase 10: Create new crate transaction (optional)**
```typescript
if (crateTransactionData) {
  // Only creates new transaction if data provided
  const [createdCrateTransaction] = await tx.insert(crateTransactions)
    .values(crateDataWithInvoice)
    .returning();
  // ...
}
```

**Conclusion:**
✅ **Backend semantics already support removal by omission**
- Phase 3 ALWAYS deletes old crate transactions (regardless of new data)
- Phase 10 ONLY creates new transaction if `crateTransactionData` is provided
- If `crateTransaction` is `undefined` in request, old one is deleted and no new one is created
- Current frontend implementation is correct

**Frontend Implementation:**
```typescript
// Current code (correct behavior)
if (data.crateTransaction?.enabled && data.crateTransaction.quantity) {
  requestData.crateTransaction = {
    partyType: 'vendor',
    vendorId: data.vendorId,
    transactionType: 'Received',
    quantity: data.crateTransaction.quantity,
    transactionDate: data.invoiceDate,
    notes: `Crates received with invoice`,
  };
}
// If not enabled, crateTransaction is undefined - backend will delete old one
```

**No Change Required:** Backend contract already handles removal correctly through the "delete all, then conditionally create new" pattern.

## Comment 5: Added form reset on modal close

**Issue:** Form state was not reset when modal was closed, potentially leaving stale data visible when reopening the modal.

**Location:** `client/src/components/forms/purchase-invoice-modal.tsx` - Error clearing useEffect

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Extended existing `open` useEffect to reset form when `open` becomes `false`
- ✅ Calls `form.reset()` to restore default values
- ✅ Clears `selectedVendorId` state
- ✅ Clears `selectedStockOutEntries` array

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
useEffect(() => {
  if (open) {
    setSubmissionError(null);
    setCalculationError(null);
  }
}, [open]);

// AFTER
useEffect(() => {
  if (open) {
    setSubmissionError(null);
    setCalculationError(null);
  } else {
    // Reset form and local state when modal is closed
    form.reset();
    setSelectedVendorId("");
    setSelectedStockOutEntries([]);
  }
}, [open, form]);
```

**Impact:** 
- Ensures clean state when reopening modal
- Prevents confusion from stale data
- Complements Comment 1 fix for complete state management
- Works in conjunction with `key` prop remounting for mode switches

## State Management Flow

### Create Mode Flow
1. User clicks "Create Invoice"
2. `handleCreateNew()` sets `editingInvoice = null`
3. Modal receives `key='create'` (causes remount if coming from edit)
4. `invoice` prop is `null` → create mode detected
5. Form uses default values
6. Vendor selection enabled
7. Stock-out query runs when vendor selected
8. User can select stock entries
9. On close, form resets via useEffect

### Edit Mode Flow
1. User clicks Edit button on unpaid invoice
2. `handleEdit(invoice)` sets `editingInvoice = invoice`
3. Modal receives `key={invoice.id}` (causes remount if coming from create)
4. `invoice` prop provided → edit mode detected
5. Form populates with invoice data
6. Vendor selection **disabled** ✅
7. Stock-out query **does not run** ✅
8. Stock entries section hidden
9. On close, form resets via useEffect

### Mode Switch Flow
1. **Edit → Create:**
   - Key changes from `invoice.id` to `'create'`
   - Component unmounts and remounts
   - All internal state cleared
   - Fresh create mode instance

2. **Create → Edit:**
   - Key changes from `'create'` to `invoice.id`
   - Component unmounts and remounts
   - All internal state cleared
   - Fresh edit mode instance with new invoice data

3. **Cancel/Close:**
   - `open` becomes `false`
   - useEffect triggers form reset
   - State cleared for next opening
   - Works with key prop for complete cleanup

## Testing Recommendations

### Regression Testing
1. ✅ **Create invoice** - Verify stock entries still work
2. ✅ **Edit invoice** - Verify vendor disabled, no stock query
3. ✅ **Edit → Create** - Verify no stale vendor/stock data
4. ✅ **Create → Edit** - Verify fresh edit state
5. ✅ **Cancel create** - Verify form resets
6. ✅ **Cancel edit** - Verify form resets
7. ✅ **Edit with crate transaction** - Disable it and verify removal
8. ✅ **Edit without crate transaction** - Enable it and verify creation

### Specific Test Cases

**Test 1: Stale State Prevention**
- Edit invoice with vendor A
- Close modal
- Click Create Invoice
- Verify: No vendor selected, no stock entries shown

**Test 2: Vendor Lock in Edit**
- Edit invoice with vendor A
- Verify: Vendor dropdown is disabled (grayed out)
- Attempt to change vendor - should be impossible

**Test 3: Stock Query Optimization**
- Edit invoice
- Open network tab
- Verify: No API call to `/api/stock-movements/vendor/.../available`

**Test 4: Crate Transaction Removal**
- Edit invoice that has crate transaction
- Uncheck "Crate Transaction" checkbox
- Submit update
- Verify: Backend deletes old crate transaction
- Verify: Vendor crate balance updated correctly

**Test 5: Form Reset on Close**
- Start creating invoice, fill some fields
- Close modal without saving
- Reopen modal
- Verify: All fields reset to defaults
