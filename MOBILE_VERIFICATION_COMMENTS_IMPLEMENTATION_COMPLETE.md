## Summary of Changes

### ✅ Comment 1: Pull-to-Refresh & Swipe-to-Delete in DataTable
**Status:** Complete

**Changes Made:**
- **DataTable Component** (`client/src/components/ui/data-table.tsx`):
  - Added new props: `onRefresh`, `enableSwipeToDelete`, `onSwipeDelete`, `swipeDeleteThreshold`
  - Integrated `usePullToRefresh` hook with ref attached to mobile card container
  - Added `PullToRefreshIndicator` component rendering
  - Created `SwipeableCard` wrapper component using `useSwipeGesture` hook
  - Implemented swipe visual feedback (red background with trash icon)
  - Added haptic feedback on swipe actions using `useHapticFeedback`

- **List Pages Updated:**
  - `client/src/pages/sales-invoices.tsx`: Added `handleRefresh` and `handleSwipeDelete` handlers
  - `client/src/pages/purchase-invoices.tsx`: Added `handleRefresh` and `handleSwipeDelete` handlers
  - `client/src/pages/items.tsx`: Added `handleRefresh` and `handleSwipeDelete` handlers
  - `client/src/pages/retailers.tsx`: Added `handleRefresh` and `handleSwipeDelete` handlers
  - All pages pass `onRefresh={handleRefresh}`, `enableSwipeToDelete={true}`, `onSwipeDelete={handleSwipeDelete}` to DataTable

### ✅ Comment 2: Mobile Drawer Modal for Forms
**Status:** Complete

**Changes Made:**
- **Sales Invoice Modal** (`client/src/components/forms/sales-invoice-modal.tsx`):
  - Replaced `Dialog` import with `MobileDrawerModal`
  - Updated component to use `<MobileDrawerModal>` with `fullScreenOnMobile={true}`
  - Removed `DialogHeader` and `DialogTitle` (handled by MobileDrawerModal props)
  
- **Purchase Invoice Modal** (`client/src/components/forms/purchase-invoice-modal.tsx`):
  - Replaced `Dialog` import with `MobileDrawerModal`
  - Updated component to use `<MobileDrawerModal>` with `fullScreenOnMobile={true}`
  - Maintained ErrorBoundary wrapper inside the modal

**Behavior:**
- On mobile (< 768px): Full-screen drawer from bottom with 95vh height
- On desktop (≥ 768px): Centered dialog modal
- Consistent API for both modes via `open` and `onOpenChange` props

---

### ✅ Comment 3: Bottom Nav CSS Variable
**Status:** Complete (Already Implemented + Mobile Media Query Added)

**Changes Made:**
- **CSS** (`client/src/index.css`):
  - Confirmed `--bottom-nav-h: 0px;` exists in `:root`
  - Added mobile media query: `@media (max-width: 767px) { :root { --bottom-nav-h: 56px; } }`
  - Added mobile-specific overrides: `overscroll-behavior-y: contain`, `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent`

- **AppLayout** (`client/src/components/layout/app-layout.tsx`):
  - Confirmed padding calculation already includes: `calc(var(--footer-h, 72px) + var(--bottom-nav-h, 0px) + 8px)`

**Result:** No content overlap on mobile; bottom nav correctly adds 56px spacing.

---

### ✅ Comment 4: Slide-Up Animation
**Status:** Complete (Added)

**Changes Made:**
- **CSS** (`client/src/index.css`):
  - Added `@keyframes slide-up` animation (translateY from 100% to 0, opacity from 0 to 1)
  - Added `.animate-slide-up` utility class
  - Added swipe animations: `swipe-out-right`, `swipe-out-left`, `pull-refresh-bounce`
  - All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query

**Usage:**
- Applied to `BottomNav` component via `animate-slide-up` class (already present)

---

### ✅ Comment 5: Search Input Data Attribute
**Status:** Complete

**Changes Made:**
- Added `data-search-input` attribute to search Input on:
  - `client/src/pages/sales-invoices.tsx` (line ~499)
  - `client/src/pages/purchase-invoices.tsx` (line ~257)
  - `client/src/pages/items.tsx` (line ~259)
  - `client/src/pages/retailers.tsx` (line ~514)

**Result:** Bottom nav "Search" button now correctly focuses the search input on each page.

---

### ✅ Comment 6: Remove Duplicate Haptic Feedback
**Status:** Complete

**Changes Made:**
- **BottomNav** (`client/src/components/layout/bottom-nav.tsx`):
  - Removed `hapticLight()` calls from `handleNewInvoice`, `handleSearch`, `handleMenu` handlers
  - Now calls props directly: `onNewInvoiceClick()`, `onSearchClick()`, `onMenuClick()`
  - Kept `hapticMedium()` for navigation links only

**Result:** Single haptic trigger per action (from AppLayout callbacks).

---

### ✅ Comment 7: Mobile Keyboard Optimizations
**Status:** Complete

**Changes Made:**
- **Sales Invoice Modal** (`client/src/components/forms/sales-invoice-modal.tsx`):
  - Invoice date: `autoComplete="off"`, `enterKeyHint="next"`
  - Paid amount: `inputMode="decimal"`, `enterKeyHint="done"`, `autoComplete="off"`
  - Weight: `inputMode="decimal"`, `enterKeyHint="next"`, `autoComplete="off"`
  - Crates: `inputMode="numeric"`, `enterKeyHint="next"`, `autoComplete="off"`
  - Boxes: `inputMode="numeric"`, `enterKeyHint="next"`, `autoComplete="off"`
  - Rate: `inputMode="decimal"`, `enterKeyHint="done"`, `autoComplete="off"`
  - Crate quantity: `inputMode="numeric"`, `enterKeyHint="done"`, `autoComplete="off"`

- **Purchase Invoice Modal** (`client/src/components/forms/purchase-invoice-modal.tsx`):
  - Same pattern applied (Dialog replaced with MobileDrawerModal in same commit)

**Result:** Optimized numeric keyboards on mobile, proper enter key hints, no autocomplete interference.

---

### ✅ Comment 8: Global vs Page-Level SalesInvoiceModal
**Status:** Complete (Layout-Level Chosen)

**Changes Made:**
- **Sales Invoices Page** (`client/src/pages/sales-invoices.tsx`):
  - Removed `open` state variable
  - Removed `SalesInvoiceModal` import
  - Removed `<SalesInvoiceModal>` component from page
  - Removed `onEmptyAction` prop from DataTable (was opening modal)
  - Updated `handleCreateNew` to no-op (modal controlled at layout level)

- **AppLayout** (`client/src/components/layout/app-layout.tsx`):
  - Kept layout-level `<SalesInvoiceModal>` (accessible from any page)
  - Bottom nav "New" button triggers `handleNewInvoiceClick` → opens layout modal

**Result:** Single source of truth at layout level; bottom nav can open modal from anywhere.

---

### ✅ Comment 9: Touch Manipulation Utility
**Status:** Complete (Added)

**Changes Made:**
- **CSS** (`client/src/index.css`):
  - Added `.touch-manipulation { touch-action: manipulation; }` in `@layer utilities`
  - Added `.touch-none { touch-action: none; }` for completeness

**Usage:**
- Referenced in Input component documentation
- Available for 44px minimum touch targets

---

### ✅ Comment 10: Swipe-to-Go-Back Gesture
**Status:** Complete

**Changes Made:**
- **AppLayout** (`client/src/components/layout/app-layout.tsx`):
  - Added imports: `useSwipeGesture`, `useIsMobile`, `useLocation`
  - Implemented `useSwipeGesture` with:
    - `onSwipeRight`: Triggers `window.history.back()` with haptic feedback
    - `enabled: isMobile` (only on mobile)
    - `threshold: 100` (higher to avoid conflicts)
    - `maxVerticalMovement: 75` (allows vertical scrolling)
  - Attached swipe ref to `SidebarInset` (main content area)
  - Guard: Doesn't trigger on dashboard/home page

**Conflict Prevention:**
- Uses higher threshold (100px vs 80px for swipe-to-delete)
- Only triggers from left edge swipe (DataTable swipe-to-delete is from card center)
- Allows more vertical movement to avoid interfering with scroll

## Implementation Notes

**All 10 verification comments have been implemented exactly as specified in the instructions.**

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Layout-level modal** chosen over page-level for global access from bottom nav
2. **Higher swipe threshold (100px)** for back gesture to prevent conflicts
3. **Mobile drawer uses 95vh height** to ensure visibility of drag handle
4. **Haptic feedback centralized** at AppLayout callback level to prevent duplicates
5. **Pull-to-refresh only on mobile** to avoid desktop scroll conflicts

**Performance Considerations:**
- Pull-to-refresh uses resistance curve to prevent jarring physics
- Swipe gestures use RAF for smooth 60fps animations
- Mobile drawer lazy-loads only when opened
- All animations respect user's reduced motion preferences

**Accessibility:**
- Pull-to-refresh indicator has `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`
- Swipe gestures provide haptic feedback for non-visual confirmation
- Touch targets maintained at minimum 44px
- Keyboard navigation preserved in all modals
